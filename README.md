## Introduction

</p>

MMRefine provides a comprehensive analysis of MLLMs' capability to detect and correct errors within a given initial solution across six distinct scenarios and six error types, which is an ability essential for test-time scaling techniques such as self-reflection or multi-agent debate.

## Requirements
To install the required packages:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You need to set your OpenAI API Key as an environment variable for evaluation. You can set it using:
```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY="<YOUR_API_KEY>"
```

## Evaluation
1. First, you need to make a submission file for evaluation with a MLLM that you want to evaluate.
    - Implement your inference code in [inference code](inference/main.py#L16).
    - Run inference to generate a `submission.json` file. Please refer to [sample_submission_file.json](inference/sample_submission_file.json).
2. Run `evaluation/main.py` with submission file you've made.
```sh
python evaluation/main.py --submission_file <path-to-your-submission-file>
```
