## Introduction

MMRefine provides a comprehensive analysis of MLLMs' capability to detect and correct errors within a given initial solution across six distinct scenarios and six error types, which is an ability essential for test-time scaling techniques such as self-reflection or multi-agent debate.

## (Recommended) Evaulation using `lmms-eval`
We strongly recommend using [lmms-eval](https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/lmms-eval), an open-source, easy-to-use evaluation tool for MLLMs that supports various MLLM families (e.g., GPT, Gemini, LLaMA).

First, install `lmms-eval`.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/lmms-eval
cd lmms-eval
uv venv dev
source dev/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .
```

Then, evaulate your model using the following code. (Please refer to [lmms-eval's docs](https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/lmms-eval/blob/main/docs/README.md) to change the model.)
```sh
python3 -m lmms_eval \
    --model openai_compatible \
    --model_args model_version=gpt-4.1,azure_openai=False \
    --tasks mmrefine \
    --batch_size 1 
```

You need to set your OpenAI API Key as an environment variable for evaluation. You can set it using:
```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY="<YOUR_API_KEY>"
```

## Evaulation using Codes in Official Repo
### Requirements
To install the required packages:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You need to set your OpenAI API Key as an environment variable for evaluation. You can set it using:
```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY="<YOUR_API_KEY>"
```

### Evaluation
1. First, you need to make a submission file for evaluation with a MLLM that you want to evaluate.
    - Implement your inference code in [inference code](inference/main.py#L16).
    - Run inference to generate a `submission.json` file. Please refer to [sample_submission_file.json](inference/sample_submission_file.json).
2. Run `evaluation/main.py` with submission file you've made.
```sh
python evaluation/main.py --submission_file <path-to-your-submission-file>
```

    abstract = "This paper introduces MMRefine, a MultiModal Refinement benchmark designed to evaluate the error refinement capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). As the emphasis shifts toward enhancing reasoning during inference, MMRefine provides a framework that evaluates MLLMs' abilities to detect and correct errors across six distinct scenarios beyond just comparing final accuracy before and after refinement. Furthermore, the benchmark analyzes the refinement performance by categorizing errors into six error types.Experiments with various open and closed MLLMs reveal bottlenecks and factors impeding refinement performance, highlighting areas for improvement in effective reasoning enhancement. Our code and dataset are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/naver-ai/MMRefine}."
